Write a function that calculates the distance between two dates, in days given the date, month, year of 2 dates

    public int daysBetween(int d1, int m1, int y1, int d2, int m2, int y2) {...}

Initially, you can ignore leap years but eventually it must be accounted for.

An array of days in each month will be given as well as a static method which calculates whether a year is a leap year.
