Given the pointer to the head node of a linked list and an integer to insert at a certain position, create a new node with the given integer as its  attribute, insert this node at the desired position and return the head node.

A position of 0 indicates head, a position of 1 indicates one node away from the head and so on. The head pointer given may be null meaning that the initial list is empty.

Example
 refers to the first node in the list 


Insert a node at position  with . The new list is 

Function Description Complete the function insertNodeAtPosition in the editor below. It must return a reference to the head node of your finished list.
